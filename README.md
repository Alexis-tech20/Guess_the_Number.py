# Guess the Number Game

A simple Python game where players guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

## How It Works
1. The program generates a random number.
2. The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. The program provides feedback:
   - "Too low" if the guess is less than the number.
   - "Too high" if the guess is greater than the number.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

## How to Play
1. Copy the code into a file named `guess_the_number.py`.
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python guess_the_number.py
